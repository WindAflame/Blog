## Welcome to my blog's source project

Here you'll find my blogs in the form of branches.
Below is the list of blogs :

|Name|Version|Status|
|---|---|---|
|hugo-initio|?|Abandonned|
|zola-linkitia|?|Deployed|

_I'm currently working on centralizing the articles so that they are compatible between each of my active blogs._

## Extra Features / Scripts

### IGDB

I've created a page and a script for the IGDB article on my blog.

You can see the source project [here](https://github.com/WindAflame/placeholder) to get the IGDB data adapted to zola-linkita.
