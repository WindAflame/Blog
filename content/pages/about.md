# Welcome to my blog!

Are you curious to find out who's behind Endy WindAflame? I'm delighted to welcome you!

By day, I'm a developer, passionate about creating and solving problems. But when night falls, I become a gamer, exploring virtual worlds and taking on new challenges.

I have a history with streaming on Twitch and YouTube, an adventure that allowed me to share my passion. Even though I'm not as active as I used to be, the desire to create and connect with others remains intact.

This blog is my space to share with you my projects, thoughts, game reviews and much more. Get ready to dive into a rich and varied universe!

Explore the articles, discover my reviews, and be surprised by my projects! Welcome to my community!
