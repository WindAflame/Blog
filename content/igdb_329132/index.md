Short description

## My review

After completing the game on Ninja difficulty (the equivalent of hard mode in most games), after about twenty hours of gameplay, I am torn about my experience.

### A Significant Episode

This episode of the series marks the addition of executions, new bosses, and a new challenge. In my opinion, it is the best Ninja Gaiden of the model released with the revival of the series on Xbox. Its adventure is divided into chapters, like beat 'em ups such as Bayonetta and Devil May Cry, except here, the game requires you to kill enemies as quickly as possible, to be reactive, to adapt to different situations, and to constantly use your ninja skills.

### What Does It Offer That Other Versions Don't?

It is nothing more than a blend of the two versions of Ninja Gaiden II with new balancing.

Compared to previous versions, it does not include the additions of Ninja Gaiden Σ2 (namely more puzzles, more bosses), except for the chapters with secondary characters, and adopts the rebalancing of the latter (fewer enemies, but they have more health; health is generated during fights; fewer weapons in the arsenal). However, it corrects a mistake from the latter, as the game is no longer censored. Goodbye to enemies disappearing in smoke!

I note that it presents the main negative points of the Σ2 version: the game is simpler and the shop is useless.

The evolution of weapons and ninpo (the spells used by our ninja) is marred by the fact that enemies are real health bags, making the evolution less interesting, unlike the original version where, indeed, there are many more enemies, but the time needed to kill them is much shorter and more satisfying. Additionally, this version introduces the blue ki initiated in Σ2 (a ki orb is randomly obtained by killing an enemy), which is too often present and allows for healing during combat. Healing consumables are no longer useful, nor is the shop. I never used it in my playthrough.

Finally, some platforming sections are adapted, shortened, or removed, making certain phases feel empty or chaining combat too quickly.

### My Verdict

For me, the first Ninja Gaiden on Xbox is the most significant because it managed to redefine the series in 3D and establish its identity: action, adventure, platforming, which makes it unique in the genre's offerings.

This one adds brutality and fatality to the execution of gameplay and variety in its approaches, which elevates it to the rank of the best episode in the series.

Unfortunately, this version offers less exploration, fewer puzzles, and fewer platforming sections. I find it to be the least interesting offering of the three. It has the great advantage of being visually updated, but I recommend the Ninja Gaiden Σ2 version, available in Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, which offers the best balance compromise.

>After 20 hours of gameplay on Ninja difficulty, I come away feeling mixed. The game is still as beautiful, fluid, and brutal as ever, but this version seems to be based on the balancing of Ninja Gaiden Σ2 (PS3) and the scripted content of the original Xbox 360. It's a shame because we lose the platforming and adventure phases and focus mainly on combat...
>
>This version offers few new features compared to the previously mentioned versions, except for a modernization with Unreal Engine 5, which makes the game very beautiful, fluid, and does not distort the original work.
>
>For long-time fans, it's a bit short: there's a sense of lack of content and a simplification that detracts from the experience. For newcomers, it's a stress reliever without any hassle... perhaps a bit too much?
>
>**Verdict**: If you've already explored the other versions, move along. If you're just starting out, you will enjoy it.
